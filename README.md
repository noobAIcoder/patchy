## üõ† How to Use

1. **Load context**

   * *Single file mode*: Open File ‚Üí choose file to patch
   * *Folder mode*: Open Folder ‚Üí base path for relative patch paths

2. **Load a diff**

   * Paste unified diff into the **Unified diff** tab
   * Or `Open Diff` to load a `.patch`/`.diff` file

3. **Preview changes**

   * Select a file in the left panel
   * View unified diff or file-specific diff in top-right tab
   * Compare **Original** vs **Preview** side-by-side

4. **Apply changes**

   * `Save Selected As` ‚Äî write patched file to a chosen location
   * `Save Selected In Place` ‚Äî overwrite original (optionally with `.bak` backup)
   * `Apply All to Folder` ‚Äî batch apply to all files in a folder context

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Architecture

* **patchy_core.py**
  Handles diff parsing (`UnifiedDiffParser`) and patch application (`DiffApplier`) with robust anchoring.
  Produces `ApplyResult` objects with both patched text and change line indices.

* **patchy.py**
  Implements the PyQt6 UI: file list, multi-pane editors, highlighters, navigation, folding, theme handling.
